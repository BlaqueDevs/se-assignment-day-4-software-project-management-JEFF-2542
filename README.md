.Use Metrics: Track defect density, test coverage, and mean time to detect/resolve bugs to measure QA effectiveness.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
                             ** How Defining Project Scope Contributes to Successful Planning**
-Defining the project scope is a critical step in project planning because it sets clear boundaries for what is (and isn’t) included in the project. A well-defined scope ensures:

.Clear Objectives & Deliverables: Everyone understands what needs to be accomplished, reducing ambiguity.
.Resource Allocation: Helps allocate time, budget, and personnel effectively.
.Prevention of Scope Creep: Scope creep happens when new features or changes are added without proper evaluation, leading to delays and cost overruns. A well-documented scope minimizes this risk.
                                      ** What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**
-A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical breakdown of all the tasks needed to complete a project. It organizes the project into smaller, more manageable parts, often structured like a tree:

.Level 1: The main project goal 
.Level 2: Major deliverables or phases
.Level 3: Sub-tasks under each deliverable
.Level 4: Further breakdown into detailed tasks
                                        **Why is WBS Useful?**
-Improved Planning and Estimation:

.Breaking work into smaller pieces makes it easier to estimate time, costs, and resources for each task.
-Task Accountability:

.Assigns responsibility for each work package, ensuring no task gets overlooked.
-Progress Tracking:

.Enables clear tracking of what’s done, what’s pending, and what’s at risk.
-Risk Management:

.Identifies potential risks at each level, so mitigation plans can be created early.
-Communication Tool:

.Provides a visual roadmap, helping teams and stakeholders easily understand the project's flow and structure.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
                                    ** Benefits of Developing a Detailed Project Schedule:**
